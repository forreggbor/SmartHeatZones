# SmartHeatZones Changelog

## Version 1.9.1 (2025-11-23) – Bugfix Release

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes – Outdoor Sensor Removal

This release fixes a long-standing issue in the Common Settings configuration:

- **Outdoor temperature sensor was not fully removable**
  - Root cause: Home Assistant’s `EntitySelector` returns `None` instead of an empty string when a field is cleared.
  - Previous logic checked only for empty strings → the field remained stored in `config_entry.options`, preventing removal.

- **Adaptive hysteresis was not automatically disabled when the outdoor sensor was removed**
  - Because the stale value remained in settings, the system incorrectly assumed the sensor was still configured.

### ✔️ Fix Details

The deletion logic in both `config_flow.py` and `options_flow.py` has been updated:

- Correctly handles `None` values returned by the selector  
- Removes `CONF_OUTDOOR_SENSOR` entirely when cleared  
- Automatically disables adaptive hysteresis  
- Ensures consistent behavior across initial setup and option editing

### 🔧 Files Changed
- `config_flow.py`
- `options_flow.py`

### 🧪 Testing
- Verified UI correctly removes outdoor sensor
- Confirmed adaptive hysteresis disables automatically when sensor is removed
- Re-tested full common settings cycle (add → save → clear → re-save)
- Confirmed zone-level adaptive hysteresis logic works correctly with missing sensor

### ⚠️ No breaking changes
This update is fully backward compatible.  
All existing configurations continue working without modification.

## Version 1.9.0 (2025-11-22) – Feature Release

### 🎉 Major Feature – Lovelace Dashboard (Phase 1 & 2)
- Complete 10-card dashboard: status, daily stats, multi-zone graph, timelines, per-zone controls, piggyback performance, efficiency score, weekly/monthly comparison, cost estimation, comfort analytics.
- 35+ new sensors/counters for heating time, piggyback events, efficiency, cost, and comfort scoring.
- Phase 1/2 helper + template YAML, Lovelace card bundles, and installation guides added under `docs/lovelace/`.

### 🧭 Notes
- Dashboard is additive; core heating logic unchanged.
- Requires ApexCharts Card (and Bar Card optionally) via HACS.

## Version 1.8.1 (2025-11-22) – Feature + Bugfix Release

### ✨ New Feature – Piggyback Heating
- When any zone starts the boiler, all zones below target heat immediately (no hysteresis) for energy-efficient piggybacking.
- Zone registration with boiler manager ensures coordinated starts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes – Outdoor Sensor Optionality
- Outdoor sensor can now be removed cleanly; options flow initializes correctly and adaptive hysteresis auto-disables when sensor is absent.
- Updated `boiler_manager.py`, `climate.py`, `options_flow.py`, `config_flow.py`, `const.py`, `manifest.json`, `__init__.py`.

## Version 1.8.0 (2025-11-18) – Feature Release

### 🎯 New Feature – Tempering Heating
- Common Settings toggle to let zones “piggyback” within hysteresis dead-band: other zones below target join while boiler is already running, reducing cycles.
- Climate logic adds `_is_any_other_zone_heating()` and exposes `tempering_heating_enabled` attribute; new constants and translations added.
- Config/Options flows updated with the tempering toggle; manifest bumped.

### 🐛 Included Fixes (v1.7.1)
- Outdoor sensor truly optional; adaptive hysteresis auto-disables when sensor missing in both setup and options flows.

## Version 1.7.0 (2025-11-08) – Feature Release

### 🎉 New Feature – Thermostat Type with Temperature Offset
- Per-zone thermostat type selector (Wall vs Radiator) with adjustable temperature offset to correct TRV readings.
- Climate logic uses adjusted targets for heating evaluation, auto restart, and exposes new attributes; new constants/defaults added.
- Zone creation/options forms updated; translations and manifest bumped to 1.7.0.

## Version 1.6.1 (2025-10-28) - Bugfix Release

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

**Common Settings Deletion Protection**
- **Issue:** Common settings could be deleted even when heating zones existed, breaking all zones
- **Fix:** Implemented `async_step_remove_entry` in ConfigFlow to block deletion
- **Behavior:** Now shows error message "Cannot delete! Remove all heating zones first."
- **Impact:** Prevents system-breaking configuration errors

**Entry Removal Validation**
- Added proper validation before allowing common settings removal
- Counts existing zone entries before allowing deletion
- Shows user-friendly abort message with clear instructions
