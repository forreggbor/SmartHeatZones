## Overview

SmartHeatZones transforms your Home Assistant installation into an intelligent, multi-zone heating control system. It provides sophisticated thermostat functionality with support for different heating types (radiators vs. underfloor heating), adaptive hysteresis, schedule-based temperature control, and coordinated boiler management.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Traditional heating systems often operate as a single zone, leading to:
- **Energy waste** from heating unoccupied rooms
- **Comfort issues** with different temperature needs in different areas

## What's New in v1.8.0

### 🎉 New Feature: Tempering Heating Mode

Version 1.8.0 introduces **Tempering Heating** - an intelligent coordinated zone heating system that significantly improves efficiency by reducing boiler on/off cycles while maintaining individual zone control.

**What is Tempering Heating?**

Tempering heating allows zones to "piggyback" on the boiler when it's already running for other zones. When enabled:
- If ANY zone turns on its heating (temperature falls below target - hysteresis)
- The system automatically turns on heating in ALL zones where current temperature < target temperature
- Each zone still maintains independent control and turns off when it reaches its target
- The boiler only turns off when all zones are satisfied

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Reduced boiler cycling** - Fewer on/off cycles extend boiler life
- 💰 **Improved efficiency** - Takes advantage of already-heated boiler water
- 🏠 **Better comfort** - All zones gradually warm up together
- 🎯 **Individual control** - Each zone still stops at its own target temperature

**How to Enable:**
1. Go to **Common Settings** in the SmartHeatZones integration
2. Toggle **Tempering Heating** to ON
3. All zones will now coordinate their heating automatically

**Note:** Tempering heating is OFF by default to maintain backward compatibility.

## What's New in v1.7.0

### 🎉 New Feature: Thermostat Type & Temperature Offset

Version 1.7.0 adds support for **radiator thermostats (TRVs)** with automatic temperature compensation:

**What's New:**
- **Thermostat Type Selection** - Choose between Wall or Radiator thermostat for each zone
- **Temperature Offset** - Configurable offset (default 3°C) for radiator thermostats
- **Automatic Compensation** - System automatically adjusts target temperatures for TRVs

**Why This Matters:**

Radiator thermostats mounted on radiator valves measure 2-5°C higher than the actual room temperature because they're close to the heat source. With this update:
- Set your desired room temperature (e.g., 22°C)
- System automatically adds the offset when using radiator thermostats
- Achieves accurate room temperature control

**Bugfixes:**
- Fixed outdoor temperature sensor to be truly optional
- Adaptive hysteresis now auto-disables when no outdoor sensor is configured
- Improved entity selector handling for optional fields

---

## Configuration

### Common Settings

Access via: **Settings → Devices & Services → SmartHeatZones → 🔧 Common Settings → Configure**

**Main Boiler Switch**
- **Purpose:** Master switch that powers your boiler/furnace
- **Behavior:** Automatically turned on when any zone needs heat, off when all zones idle
- **Important:** All zones must use the SAME boiler switch
- **Example:** `switch.shelly_boiler_relay`

**Base Hysteresis**
- **Purpose:** Prevents rapid on/off cycling (relay chattering)
- **Range:** 0.1°C to 2.0°C
- **Recommended:** 0.3°C for most systems, 0.5°C for older equipment
- **Note:** Only applies to radiator mode, not underfloor heating
- **How it works:** 
  - Heat turns ON when: `current_temp < target_temp - hysteresis`
  - Heat turns OFF when: `current_temp > target_temp + hysteresis`

**Overheat Protection**
- **Purpose:** Emergency safety shutoff
- **Range:** 22.0°C to 35.0°C
- **Recommended:** 26.0°C for comfort, 28.0°C for industrial
- **Behavior:** Immediately shuts off zone if temperature exceeds this limit
- **Safety:** Prevents damage from sensor failure or runaway heating

**Outdoor Temperature Sensor**
- **Purpose:** Enables adaptive hysteresis feature
- **Optional:** System works without it, but less efficient
- **Recommendation:** Use if available for better energy efficiency
- **Example:** `sensor.outdoor_temperature`

**Adaptive Hysteresis**
- **Purpose:** Automatically increases hysteresis in cold weather
- **Requires:** Outdoor temperature sensor
- **Behavior:**
  - Outdoor temp < -10°C: 2.0× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp < 0°C: 1.5× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp < 10°C: 1.2× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp ≥ 10°C: 1.0× base hysteresis
- **Benefit:** More stable heating in extreme cold, responsive in mild weather

### Zone Configuration

Access via: **Settings → Devices & Services → SmartHeatZones → [Zone Name] → Configure**

Each zone options screen shows:

**Common Settings Summary Panel** (read-only info):
- Current boiler switch
- Outdoor sensor (if configured)
- Active hysteresis value
- Overheat protection limit
- Adaptive hysteresis status

**Zone-Specific Settings:**

**Heating Mode** (REQUIRED)
- **🔥 Radiator:**
  - Uses hysteresis for smooth operation
  - Gradual heat distribution
  - Best for traditional radiators
  - Example: Cast iron radiators, panel radiators

- **🌡️ Underfloor Heating:**
  - NO hysteresis (instant on/off)
  - Compensates for thermal inertia
  - Floor continues heating after shutoff
  - Prevents overshoot
  - Example: Wet underfloor systems, electric mats

**Zone Temperature Sensor** (REQUIRED)
- Select the sensor that measures this zone's temperature
- Must be a numeric sensor entity
- Should be positioned at representative location (not near heat sources)
- Example: `sensor.living_room_temperature`

**Zone Relays** (REQUIRED, Multiple Allowed)
- Select one or more switches that control this zone
- Can control pumps, valves, or both
- All selected relays operate together (on/off simultaneously)
- Examples:
  - `switch.zone_pump_1`
  - `switch.zone_valve_actuator`
  - Both together for redundant control

**Door/Window Sensors** (OPTIONAL, Multiple Allowed)
- Select binary sensors that detect open doors/windows
- When ANY sensor is open → heating pauses
- When ALL sensors close → heating resumes
- Saves energy by not heating open rooms
- Examples:
  - `binary_sensor.living_room_window`
  - `binary_sensor.patio_door`

**Schedule Configuration (4 Periods)**

Each period has:
- **Period name:** Descriptive label (e.g., "Night", "Morning", "Day", "Evening")
- **Start time:** When period begins (HH:MM format)
- **End time:** When period ends (HH:MM format)
- **Target temperature:** Desired temperature during this period

**Schedule Rules:**
- Periods can span midnight (e.g., 22:00 to 06:00 for night)
- If periods overlap, earlier defined period takes precedence
- Empty periods are ignored
- Used when preset mode is set to "Auto"

**Example Schedule:**
```
Period 1 - Night:     22:00 - 06:00 → 19°C (energy saving)
Period 2 - Morning:   06:00 - 09:00 → 22°C (wake-up comfort)
Period 3 - Day:       09:00 - 17:00 → 20°C (away/reduced)
Period 4 - Evening:   17:00 - 22:00 → 22°C (home comfort)
```

## Advanced Features

### Adaptive Hysteresis

**How It Works:**
- Monitors outdoor temperature
- Automatically adjusts hysteresis multiplier
- Provides more stable operation in extreme cold
- Reduces cycling in moderate weather

**Multiplier Table:**
| Outdoor Temp | Multiplier | Example (0.3°C base) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| < -10°C      | 2.0×      | 0.6°C              |
| -10°C to 0°C | 1.5×      | 0.45°C             |
| 0°C to 10°C  | 1.2×      | 0.36°C             |
| ≥ 10°C       | 1.0×      | 0.3°C              |

**Benefits:**
- Reduces boiler starts in very cold weather
- Extends equipment lifetime
- Improves comfort through steadier heating
- Automatically optimizes based on conditions

**Requirements:**
- Outdoor temperature sensor configured in common settings
- Adaptive hysteresis enabled in common settings
- Sensor must provide reliable readings

### Door/Window Detection

**Automatic Heating Pause:**
- When ANY configured door/window opens → zone heating pauses
- When ALL doors/windows close → heating resumes
- No manual intervention required

**Energy Savings:**
- Prevents heating while ventilating
- Typical savings: 5-15% on heating bills
- Especially effective for rooms with frequent ventilation

**Sensor Requirements:**
- Must be `binary_sensor` entities
- "on" state = open/detected
- "off" state = closed/not detected
- Can use contact sensors, magnetic switches, or smart sensors

**Limitations:**
- All sensors treated equally (no priority)
- No delay/grace period (instant response)
- Cannot pause specific relays, only entire zone

### Overheat Protection

**Safety Mechanism:**
- Continuously monitors zone temperature
- Compares against overheat protection limit
- If limit exceeded → immediate shutdown

**Shutdown Behavior:**
- All zone relays turn OFF immediately
- Zone marked as inactive
- Boiler manager notified (may turn off boiler)
- Error logged for diagnostics

**Recovery:**
- Automatic when temperature drops below limit
- No manual reset required
- Normal operation resumes

**Use Cases:**
- Sensor malfunction detection
- Stuck relay protection
- Thermostat failure safety
- Occupant safety

### Boiler Coordination

**Intelligent Boiler Management:**
- Single boiler serves multiple zones
- Automatically coordinates when to run boiler
- Prevents premature shutoff
- Optimizes for efficiency

**How It Works:**
1. Each zone reports heating status to Boiler Manager
2. Boiler Manager maintains set of active zones
3. If ANY zone active → boiler ON
4. If ALL zones inactive → boiler OFF
5. Redundant commands filtered (no relay chattering)

**Benefits:**
- No manual boiler control needed
- Optimal runtime (not too short, not too long)
- Works seamlessly with multiple zones
- Reduces wear on boiler relay

**Important:**
- All zones MUST use the same boiler switch
- Configured once in common settings
- Automatically propagated to all zones

### Manual Override Detection

**Event-Based Monitoring:**
- Real-time detection of external relay changes
- Instantly updates internal state
- Synchronizes boiler coordination
- Maintains system consistency

**Override Sources:**
- Manual physical switch operation
- Other automations controlling same relays
- Direct service calls to relay entities
- External integrations

**System Response:**
- Detects change within seconds
- Updates zone heating status
- Notifies Boiler Manager
- Logs override event

**Use Cases:**
- Emergency manual shutoff
- Testing relay operation
- Integration with other systems
- Maintenance procedures

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smartheatzones: debug
```

**Restart Home Assistant**

**View logs:**
- Settings → System → Logs
- Or check `home-assistant.log` file

**What to look for:**
- `[SmartHeatZones]` prefix on all integration logs
- Sensor updates with temperature values
- Relay turn_on / turn_off commands
- Boiler coordination events
- Schedule evaluations
- Error messages

**Useful log patterns:**
- `Sensor: XX.X°C` - Temperature reading
- `Heating ON/OFF` - State changes
- `Boiler relay XX → ON/OFF` - Boiler commands
- `Schedule: Period (XX°C)` - Schedule application
- `OVERHEAT!` - Safety triggered
- `Manual adjustment` - User interaction

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use SmartHeatZones with a heat pump?**
A: Yes, as long as you can control it with a switch entity in Home Assistant.

**Q: Do I need separate temperature sensors for each zone?**
A: Yes, each zone requires its own temperature sensor for accurate control.

**Q: Can I mix radiators and underfloor heating?**
A: Yes! Configure heating mode per zone (radiator vs. underfloor).

**Q: What happens if my internet goes down?**
A: SmartHeatZones operates locally within Home Assistant. Internet not required for operation.

**Q: Can I use this with Better Thermostat integration?**
A: SmartHeatZones IS a complete thermostat solution. Better Thermostat not needed.

**Q: How do I add more languages?**
A: Copy `en.json` or `hu.json` in the `translations/` folder, translate, and submit a PR.

**Q: Can zones share relays?**
A: Not recommended. Each zone should have dedicated relays for proper control.

**Q: What if I delete the common settings by mistake?**
A: You'll need to recreate it. Zones won't work without common settings.

**Q: Can I have different schedules per day of week?**
A: Not currently. Same schedule applies every day. Use automations for day-of-week control.

**Q: Does this work with gas/electric/oil boilers?**
A: Yes, SmartHeatZones works with any heating system controllable via a switch.

## Changelog

### v1.7.0 (Current - Feature Release)
**Release Date:** November 8, 2025

**🎉 New Feature: Thermostat Type with Temperature Offset**

**Problem Solved:**
Radiator-mounted thermostats (TRVs - Thermostatic Radiator Valves) measure higher temperatures than the actual room temperature because they're positioned directly on the hot radiator. This causes the heating system to shut off prematurely, leaving rooms colder than desired.

**Solution:**
- **Thermostat Type Selection:** Choose between "Wall Thermostat" (accurate room measurement) or "Radiator Thermostat" (mounted on radiator)
- **Temperature Offset:** Configurable temperature compensation (default: 3°C) that's automatically added to the target temperature when using radiator thermostats
- **Per-Zone Configuration:** Each zone can have different thermostat types

**How It Works:**
- User sets target temperature: 21°C
- With radiator thermostat + 3°C offset: System heats to 24°C (sensor reading)
- Actual room temperature reaches ~21°C (desired comfort level)

**Configuration:**
- Zone Settings → "Thermostat Type": Wall / Radiator
- Zone Settings → "Temperature Offset (°C)": 0.0 - 10.0 (default: 3.0)

**📝 Changes:**
- Added `thermostat_type` field to zone configuration (wall/radiator)
- Added `temp_offset` field for temperature compensation (0.0-10.0°C, default 3.0°C)
- Implemented `_get_adjusted_target_temp()` method in climate entity
- Updated heating evaluation logic to use adjusted target temperature
- Added new attributes to climate entity: `thermostat_type`, `temp_offset`, `adjusted_target_temp`
- Updated all translation files (EN, HU) with new field labels and descriptions

**🔧 Technical Details:**
- Adaptive hysteresis and temperature offset work independently and complement each other
- Adaptive hysteresis: adjusts based on outdoor temperature (external factor)
- Temperature offset: compensates for thermostat placement (measurement accuracy)
- Debug logging includes both target and adjusted target temperatures

**⚠️ Note:**
- Existing zones default to "Wall Thermostat" type with 0°C offset (no behavior change)
- This feature is independent of "Heating Mode" (Radiator vs Underfloor)
- Temperature offset only applies when thermostat type is set to "Radiator"
