## Configuration

### Common Settings

Access via: **Settings → Devices & Services → SmartHeatZones → 🔧 Common Settings → Configure**

**Main Boiler Switch**
- **Purpose:** Master switch that powers your boiler/furnace
- **Behavior:** Automatically turned on when any zone needs heat, off when all zones idle
- **Important:** All zones must use the SAME boiler switch
- **Example:** `switch.shelly_boiler_relay`

**Base Hysteresis**
- **Purpose:** Prevents rapid on/off cycling (relay chattering)
- **Range:** 0.1°C to 2.0°C
- **Recommended:** 0.3°C for most systems, 0.5°C for older equipment
- **Note:** Only applies to radiator mode, not underfloor heating
- **How it works:** 
  - Heat turns ON when: `current_temp < target_temp - hysteresis`
  - Heat turns OFF when: `current_temp > target_temp + hysteresis`

**Overheat Protection**
- **Purpose:** Emergency safety shutoff
- **Range:** 22.0°C to 35.0°C
- **Recommended:** 26.0°C for comfort, 28.0°C for industrial
- **Behavior:** Immediately shuts off zone if temperature exceeds this limit
- **Safety:** Prevents damage from sensor failure or runaway heating

**Outdoor Temperature Sensor**
- **Purpose:** Enables adaptive hysteresis feature
- **Optional:** System works without it, but less efficient
- **Recommendation:** Use if available for better energy efficiency
- **Example:** `sensor.outdoor_temperature`

**Adaptive Hysteresis**
- **Purpose:** Automatically increases hysteresis in cold weather
- **Requires:** Outdoor temperature sensor
- **Behavior:**
  - Outdoor temp < -10°C: 2.0× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp < 0°C: 1.5× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp < 10°C: 1.2× base hysteresis
  - Outdoor temp ≥ 10°C: 1.0× base hysteresis
- **Benefit:** More stable heating in extreme cold, responsive in mild weather

### Zone Configuration

Access via: **Settings → Devices & Services → SmartHeatZones → [Zone Name] → Configure**

Each zone options screen shows:

**Common Settings Summary Panel** (read-only info):
- Current boiler switch
- Outdoor sensor (if configured)
- Active hysteresis value
- Overheat protection limit
- Adaptive hysteresis status

**Zone-Specific Settings:**

**Heating Mode** (REQUIRED)
- **🔥 Radiator:**
  - Uses hysteresis for smooth operation
  - Gradual heat distribution
  - Best for traditional radiators
  - Example: Cast iron radiators, panel radiators

- **🌡️ Underfloor Heating:**
  - NO hysteresis (instant on/off)
  - Compensates for thermal inertia
  - Floor continues heating after shutoff
  - Prevents overshoot
  - Example: Wet underfloor systems, electric mats

**Zone Temperature Sensor** (REQUIRED)
- Select the sensor that measures this zone's temperature
- Must be a numeric sensor entity
- Should be positioned at representative location (not near heat sources)
- Example: `sensor.living_room_temperature`

**Zone Relays** (REQUIRED, Multiple Allowed)
- Select one or more switches that control this zone
- Can control pumps, valves, or both
- All selected relays operate together (on/off simultaneously)
- Examples:
  - `switch.zone_pump_1`
  - `switch.zone_valve_actuator`
  - Both together for redundant control

**Door/Window Sensors** (OPTIONAL, Multiple Allowed)
- Select binary sensors that detect open doors/windows
- When ANY sensor is open → heating pauses
- When ALL sensors close → heating resumes
- Saves energy by not heating open rooms
- Examples:
  - `binary_sensor.living_room_window`
  - `binary_sensor.patio_door`

**Schedule Configuration (4 Periods)**

Each period has:
- **Period name:** Descriptive label (e.g., "Night", "Morning", "Day", "Evening")
- **Start time:** When period begins (HH:MM format)
- **End time:** When period ends (HH:MM format)
- **Target temperature:** Desired temperature during this period

**Schedule Rules:**
- Periods can span midnight (e.g., 22:00 to 06:00 for night)
- If periods overlap, earlier defined period takes precedence
- Empty periods are ignored
- Used when preset mode is set to "Auto"

**Example Schedule:**
```
Period 1 - Night:     22:00 - 06:00 → 19°C (energy saving)
Period 2 - Morning:   06:00 - 09:00 → 22°C (wake-up comfort)
Period 3 - Day:       09:00 - 17:00 → 20°C (away/reduced)
Period 4 - Evening:   17:00 - 22:00 → 22°C (home comfort)
```

## Advanced Features

### Adaptive Hysteresis

**How It Works:**
- Monitors outdoor temperature
- Automatically adjusts hysteresis multiplier
- Provides more stable operation in extreme cold
- Reduces cycling in moderate weather

**Multiplier Table:**
| Outdoor Temp | Multiplier | Example (0.3°C base) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| < -10°C      | 2.0×      | 0.6°C              |
| -10°C to 0°C | 1.5×      | 0.45°C             |
| 0°C to 10°C  | 1.2×      | 0.36°C             |
| ≥ 10°C       | 1.0×      | 0.3°C              |

**Benefits:**
- Reduces boiler starts in very cold weather
- Extends equipment lifetime
- Improves comfort through steadier heating
- Automatically optimizes based on conditions

**Requirements:**
- Outdoor temperature sensor configured in common settings
- Adaptive hysteresis enabled in common settings
- Sensor must provide reliable readings

### Door/Window Detection

**Automatic Heating Pause:**
- When ANY configured door/window opens → zone heating pauses
- When ALL doors/windows close → heating resumes
- No manual intervention required

**Energy Savings:**
- Prevents heating while ventilating
- Typical savings: 5-15% on heating bills
- Especially effective for rooms with frequent ventilation

**Sensor Requirements:**
- Must be `binary_sensor` entities
- "on" state = open/detected
- "off" state = closed/not detected
- Can use contact sensors, magnetic switches, or smart sensors

**Limitations:**
- All sensors treated equally (no priority)
- No delay/grace period (instant response)
- Cannot pause specific relays, only entire zone

### Overheat Protection

**Safety Mechanism:**
- Continuously monitors zone temperature
- Compares against overheat protection limit
- If limit exceeded → immediate shutdown

**Shutdown Behavior:**
- All zone relays turn OFF immediately
- Zone marked as inactive
- Boiler manager notified (may turn off boiler)
- Error logged for diagnostics

**Recovery:**
- Automatic when temperature drops below limit
- No manual reset required
- Normal operation resumes

**Use Cases:**
- Sensor malfunction detection
- Stuck relay protection
- Thermostat failure safety
- Occupant safety

### Boiler Coordination

**Intelligent Boiler Management:**
- Single boiler serves multiple zones
- Automatically coordinates when to run boiler
- Prevents premature shutoff
- Optimizes for efficiency

**How It Works:**
1. Each zone reports heating status to Boiler Manager
2. Boiler Manager maintains set of active zones
3. If ANY zone active → boiler ON
4. If ALL zones inactive → boiler OFF
5. Redundant commands filtered (no relay chattering)

**Benefits:**
- No manual boiler control needed
- Optimal runtime (not too short, not too long)
- Works seamlessly with multiple zones
- Reduces wear on boiler relay

**Important:**
- All zones MUST use the same boiler switch
- Configured once in common settings
- Automatically propagated to all zones

### Manual Override Detection

**Event-Based Monitoring:**
- Real-time detection of external relay changes
- Instantly updates internal state
- Synchronizes boiler coordination
- Maintains system consistency

**Override Sources:**
- Manual physical switch operation
- Other automations controlling same relays
- Direct service calls to relay entities
- External integrations

**System Response:**
- Detects change within seconds
- Updates zone heating status
- Notifies Boiler Manager
- Logs override event

**Use Cases:**
- Emergency manual shutoff
- Testing relay operation
- Integration with other systems
- Maintenance procedures

### Entity Attributes

Each `climate.<zone>` entity exposes:

**Standard Climate Attributes:**
- `current_temperature` - Current zone temperature
- `temperature` - Target temperature (adjustable)
- `hvac_mode` - Current mode (heat or off)
- `hvac_action` - Current action (heating, idle, or off)
- `preset_mode` - Active preset (auto, manual, comfort, eco, away)

**Custom Attributes:**
- `heating_mode` - Radiator or underfloor
- `base_hysteresis` - Configured hysteresis value
- `effective_hysteresis` - Current hysteresis (may be adaptive)
- `outdoor_temperature` - If configured
- `overheat_protection` - Safety limit

**Supported Features:**
- `TEMPERATURE` - Can set target temperature
- `PRESET_MODE` - Can select preset modes

**Supported Services:**
- `climate.set_temperature` - Set target temperature
- `climate.set_hvac_mode` - Change HVAC mode
- `climate.set_preset_mode` - Change preset mode

### State Restoration

**On Home Assistant Restart:**
1. Integration reloads all zones
2. Last known state restored:
   - Target temperature
   - HVAC mode
   - Preset mode
3. Current temperature read from sensor
4. Heating logic re-evaluated
5. Normal operation resumes

**Persistence:**
- All configuration in `.storage/core.config_entries`
- State history in recorder database
- Logs rotated automatically

### Performance Characteristics

**Resource Usage:**
- Minimal CPU impact (event-driven)
- Low memory footprint (~1MB per zone)
- No polling (state change events only)

**Timing:**
- Sensor updates: Instant (event-based)
- Relay commands: <1 second
- Boiler coordination: <1 second
- Schedule checks: Every 15 minutes
- Manual override detection: <2 seconds

**Scalability:**
- Tested with up to 10 zones
- No theoretical limit
- Each zone operates independently
- Boiler Manager handles any number of zones

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use SmartHeatZones with a heat pump?**
A: Yes, as long as you can control it with a switch entity in Home Assistant.

**Q: Do I need separate temperature sensors for each zone?**
A: Yes, each zone requires its own temperature sensor for accurate control.

**Q: Can I mix radiators and underfloor heating?**
A: Yes! Configure heating mode per zone (radiator vs. underfloor).

**Q: What happens if my internet goes down?**
A: SmartHeatZones operates locally within Home Assistant. Internet not required for operation.

**Q: Can I use this with Better Thermostat integration?**
A: SmartHeatZones IS a complete thermostat solution. Better Thermostat not needed.

**Q: How do I add more languages?**
A: Copy `en.json` or `hu.json` in the `translations/` folder, translate, and submit a PR.

**Q: Can zones share relays?**
A: Not recommended. Each zone should have dedicated relays for proper control.

**Q: What if I delete the common settings by mistake?**
A: You'll need to recreate it. Zones won't work without common settings.

**Q: Can I have different schedules per day of week?**
A: Not currently. Same schedule applies every day. Use automations for day-of-week control.

**Q: Does this work with gas/electric/oil boilers?**
A: Yes, SmartHeatZones works with any heating system controllable via a switch.
