**Type:** Feature Release
**Compatibility:** Home Assistant 2025.10+

## 🎉 What's New

### Tempering Heating Mode - Coordinated Zone Heating

Version 1.8.0 introduces **Tempering Heating**, an intelligent coordinated zone heating system that significantly improves efficiency by reducing boiler on/off cycles while maintaining individual zone control.

#### How It Works

When tempering heating is enabled:

1. **Normal Heating Trigger**: When any zone's temperature falls below (target - hysteresis), that zone's heating turns on normally
2. **Piggyback Activation**: All other zones check if their current temperature < target temperature (ignoring hysteresis)
3. **Coordinated Heating**: Zones below target automatically turn on to "piggyback" on the boiler heat
4. **Individual Shutoff**: Each zone monitors its own temperature and turns off when it reaches its target
5. **Boiler Shutoff**: The boiler only turns off when ALL zones are satisfied

#### Benefits

- ⚡ **Reduced Boiler Cycling** - Significantly fewer on/off cycles extend boiler life
- 💰 **Improved Efficiency** - Takes advantage of already-heated boiler water
- 🏠 **Better Comfort** - All zones gradually warm up together
- 🎯 **Individual Control** - Each zone still stops at its own target temperature
- 🔧 **Easy to Use** - Simple toggle in Common Settings

#### Example Scenario

**Without Tempering Heating:**
- Zone A: Heats 8:00-8:30, boiler ON
- Zone B: Heats 8:35-9:05, boiler ON again
- Zone C: Heats 9:10-9:40, boiler ON again
- **Result:** 3 separate boiler cycles

**With Tempering Heating:**
- Zone A: Needs heat at 8:00, triggers heating
- Zones B & C: Below target, automatically join
- All zones heat together 8:00-9:05
- **Result:** 1 boiler cycle instead of 3

## 📝 Technical Details

### Modified Files

**Core Logic:**
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/climate.py` - Tempering heating implementation
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/const.py` - New constants

**Configuration:**
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/config_flow.py` - Added tempering toggle to initial setup
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/options_flow.py` - Added tempering toggle to options editing

**Translations:**
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/strings.json` - Hungarian translations
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/translations/en.json` - English translations
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/translations/hu.json` - Hungarian translations

**Metadata:**
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/manifest.json` - Version bump to 1.8.0
- `README.md` - Updated with v1.8.0 features

### New Constants

```python
CONF_TEMPERING_HEATING = "tempering_heating_enabled"  # Configuration key
DEFAULT_TEMPERING_HEATING = False  # Default value (disabled)
```

### Heating Evaluation Logic

The tempering heating mode operates within the hysteresis dead-band:

```python
if diff > effective_hysteresis:
    # Normal heating - below target - hysteresis
    turn_on_heating()
elif diff < -effective_hysteresis:
    # Too warm - above target + hysteresis
    turn_off_heating()
else:
    # In dead-band - check tempering heating
    if tempering_enabled and any_other_zone_heating():
        if current_temp < target:
            turn_on_heating()  # Piggyback
        elif current_temp >= target:
            turn_off_heating()  # Target reached
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### Enable Tempering Heating

1. Open Home Assistant
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
3. Find **SmartHeatZones** integration
4. Click on **🔧 Közös beállítások** (Common Settings)
5. Toggle **Melegítő fűtés** (Tempering Heating) to **ON**
6. Click **Submit**

All zones will immediately begin coordinating their heating cycles.

### Monitor Behavior

Check entity attributes to see tempering heating status:

```yaml
climate.zone_name:
  tempering_heating_enabled: true
  current_temperature: 21.5
  adjusted_target_temp: 22.0
  is_heating: true
```

### Disable Tempering Heating

Follow the same steps above and toggle to **OFF**. All zones will immediately return to independent operation.

## 🔄 Upgrade Notes

### From v1.7.0

1. **Automatic Upgrade**: Simply update to v1.8.0
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Tempering heating is OFF by default
3. **Existing Behavior Preserved**: Your zones will continue to operate independently until you enable tempering heating
4. **No Configuration Required**: The new toggle appears automatically in Common Settings

### Configuration Migration

- No manual configuration changes needed
- Existing zone settings are preserved
- Common settings automatically gain the new tempering heating option

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Compatibility
- **Minimum Home Assistant Version**: 2025.10+
- **Compatible With**: All SmartHeatZones v1.6.0+ installations
- **Backward Compatible**: Completely backward compatible with existing setups

### Limitations
- Tempering heating only works with **radiator mode** zones (not underfloor heating)
- Zones must be in **HEAT** mode (not OFF) to participate in tempering
- Door/window sensors still override tempering heating (safety first)

### Best Practices
- **Test First**: Enable tempering heating and monitor for a few days
- **Adjust Schedules**: You may want to adjust schedule temperatures after enabling
- **Monitor Logs**: Check logs to see tempering heating behavior
- **Fine-Tune**: Adjust base hysteresis if needed for optimal performance

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### v1.7.1 Patches Included

This release includes critical bugfixes from v1.7.1:

**Outdoor Temperature Sensor - Truly Optional**
- **Issue**: Outdoor sensor field required non-empty value, preventing users from saving Common Settings without selecting a sensor
- **Root Cause**: Home Assistant EntitySelector rejects empty strings ("") as invalid
- **Fix**: Changed default value from `""` to `None` in both config_flow.py and options_flow.py
- **Impact**: Users can now save Common Settings without selecting an outdoor sensor

**Adaptive Hysteresis Auto-Disable**
- **Issue**: Adaptive hysteresis could be enabled without an outdoor sensor, causing errors
- **Fix**: System now automatically disables adaptive hysteresis when outdoor sensor is not configured
- **Locations**: Both initial setup (config_flow.py) and options editing (options_flow.py)
- **Behavior**: When outdoor sensor is removed or not configured, adaptive hysteresis automatically turns OFF
- **Fallback**: System uses base hysteresis (DEFAULT_HYSTERESIS = 0.3°C) when adaptive is disabled

**Files Modified for Bug Fixes:**
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/config_flow.py` - Lines 94-102
- `custom_components/smartheatzones/options_flow.py` - Lines 112, 357-363

These fixes ensure the outdoor temperature sensor is truly optional and prevent configuration errors.
